<h1 align=center> Skin Cancer Analyzer and Detector </h1>

A Web Application that uses Computer Vision and Deep Learning to identify the three highest probability diagnoses for a skin lesion image input by the User.

> **Warning**
> This is a prototype.  The model was trained using image data that was released under a CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 licence. That means that this app cannot be used for commercial purposes.

> **Note**
> Image format: The app accepts images in either jpg or png format of any size.
